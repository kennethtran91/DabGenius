      lyrics:
        "[Hook 1: J. Cole]
        Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
        She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
        She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
        She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
        She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
        She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
        She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
        She got me open all night, got me open all night

        [Verse 1: J. Cole]
        Okay, back when I was sleepin' in my mama's crib
        Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
        Payin' seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
        No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
        Had a thing for you, even wrote the song dreams for you
        Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
        Childish shit, you know childish shit
        Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
        Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
        Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
        The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
        Life got crisscrossed, Totally Krossed Out
        Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
        Old chicks cryin' cause they know that they lost out
        But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
        My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you
        I'm saying...

        [Hook 2: Miguel & J. Cole]
        Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
        Baby, I want you to want me
        Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
        Baby, I want ya
        And we are, we are, we are
        Got me up all night
        And we are, we are, we are
        All I'm singin' is love songs
        And we are, we are, we are
        Got me up all night
        And we are, we are, we are
        She got me
        And we are, we are, we are
        She got me

        [Verse 2: J. Cole]
        Well this has gotta be the longest crush ever
        If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
        Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
        And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
        She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
        Wifin' in the club, man my homies gon' disown a nigga
        Like, give me 20 dolla, dolla
        Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
        I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
        Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now
        Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, clicheÃÅ
        I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
        Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
        But you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin', Please play!
        For Pete's sake, homie pull it together
        Just fuck her one time and be through it forever
        But...
